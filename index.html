                Tamagotchi, meaning "egg watch" in Japanese, is a handheld
                digital pet game. Players, mostly children, are responsible for
                taking care of the virtual pet by feeding it, playing games, and
                keeping it clean. It was a popular toy in the late 1990s and
                early 2000s both in Japan and the US.

                  <b>Fun Fact: </b>Aki Maita, employee at Bandai, came up with
                  the idea of Tamagotchi because she wanted to make a pet for
                  kids without the responsibility of cleaning up after them,
                  dealing with loud noises, or paying large vet bills

              <p>
                As an extension of the virtual pet series, Digimon was created
                by the manufacturers of Tamagotchi with the intention of
                targeting male children. This virtual pet later evolved into a
                franchise, expanding into anime and video games. While the
                original virtual pet game focused on the growth of the pet, the
                franchise later became more oriented towards training and
                competition.

                dogs. This game became very popular by using the Nintendo DS's
