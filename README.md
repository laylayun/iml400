## What is this Project?

This project surveys virtual pets from 1996 to 2021. Upon research, it was interesting to see that the integral function of virtual pets in the earlier years (1996-2005) was the growth of the pet while in more recent years (2014-2021) is the relaxation of the player.
As the device the virtual pet is showcased on converges with devices used for work (lap tops, smartphones), users started craving relaxation than another responsibility to take care afer.
